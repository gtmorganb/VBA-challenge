This homework assignment was very exciting to complete! 

The excel spreadsheets within this folder show various stock data from different years and entities. The code written helps analyze the performance of each entity's stocks. 

The following are the outputs created by the code for each entity:  
    - Ticker 
    - Yearly Change (in $)
    - Percent Change 
    - Total Volume 

The code also outputs general information for overall statistics including: 
    - Greatest overall decrease 
    - Greatest overall increase 
    - Greatest overall volume
