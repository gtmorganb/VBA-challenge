This homework assignment was very exciting to complete! 

The excel spreadsheets within this folder show various stock data from different years and entities. The code written helps analyze the performance of each entity's stocks. 

The following are the outputs created by the code for each entity:  

    - Ticker 
    - Yearly Change (in $)
    - Percent Change 
    - Total Volume 

The code also outputs general information for overall statistics including: 

    - Greatest overall decrease 
    - Greatest overall increase 
    - Greatest overall volume 

There are three photos attached with this assignment for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 stock data respectively.

I was able to get do the Percent Increase, Decrease and Total Volume; however, I did not complete adding the ticker to those values.
